# Happy Birthday

## Introduction
- This project uses Jetpack Compose to build a simple Android app, that displays a birthday message on the screen.
- Building this very simple text app was part of my learning in Makers Module 3 - Mobile Applications: Android applications.
- It follows the official [Android documentation tutorial](https://developer.android.com/codelabs/basic-android-kotlin-compose-text-composables#0)
